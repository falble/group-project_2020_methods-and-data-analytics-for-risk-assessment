Final project for the course of methods and data analytics for risk assessment. 

**Francesco Albertini**, **Davide Boero**, **Salvatore Faraone**,  **Filippo Lafronza**, **Utkan Peker**, **Guglielmo Ranieri**.

The goal of the project is to map, using a Bayesian Network, the way on which changes in emissions, caused both by natural forces or anthropogenic ones, might influence the rise in the global temperature and consequently modify the frequency/intensity of extreme weather events.
